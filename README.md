# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse_1

Gesturally Controlled Virtual Mouse simplifies man-machine interaction simply by Hand Gesture. Almost entirely free of physical contact with a computer, almost all the input/output operations on the computer become virtually under total control using either static and or dynamic hand-gestures alone. It follows state-of-art Machine Learning/Computer Vision technology to interpret all hand gestures alone without extra peripheral hardware support requirements.

It uses the models, for example, CNN implemented by MediaPipe running on top of pybind11. The system has two modules: one which directly detects hands with the use of MediaPipe Hand Detection and the other that works with gloves of any uniform color. It's currently designed to run on the Windows platform.
